        <li>1 cup brown basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon amchur (dried mango powder)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced</li>
        <li>1 green Thai chile, minced (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 Roma tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice in plenty of cold water. Put into a small, oven-safe dish that will fit inside a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Cover with water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine cumin seeds, amchur, coriander, garam masala, paprika, turmeric, pepper, and ground cayenne in a small bowl for the spice mix. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour chickpeas into the cooker and cover with 2 cups cold water. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Manually release any remaining pressure, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove the chickpeas, reserving cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Place oil in the pot and select Saute function. Add onion, carrot, and bay leaf; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in spice mix, garlic, ginger, Thai chile, and 1/4 cup of the reserved chickpea liquid; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Cancel Saute function.</li>
        <li>Mix in chickpeas and remaining liquid, tomatoes, and tomato paste. Place a trivet inside.</li>
        <li>Drain rice and return to the dish. Cover with 1 1/4 cups fresh water. Place the dish on top of the trivet. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 25 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release any remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Carefully lift out the rice; fluff with a fork. Remove the trivet and bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to blend just a small amount of chickpeas to create a creamy texture, 2 to 3 pulses on high speed.</li>
        <li>Evenly distribute rice and chana masala among 5 plates. Top with chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
